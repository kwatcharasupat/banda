# Design Document: Improving Extensibility of the `banda` Codebase

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to enhance the modularity and adaptability of the `banda` codebase, a research platform for music source separation. The primary goal is to ensure the codebase is easily extensible for future research and development, accommodating changes in architectural components, datasets, losses, metrics, optimizers, and queries.
