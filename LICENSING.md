# Licensing

## Academic and Non-Commercial Research Use (AGPLv3)
For academic research and non-commercial purposes, this project is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3). This license ensures that if you distribute or make the software's functionality available over a network, you must also make the source code available under the same terms.

License Text: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html

Applicability: This license applies to individuals and organizations engaged purely in academic research, personal learning, or non-profit activities that do not generate direct or indirect commercial revenue.

## Commercial Use (Proprietary Commercial License)
For all other uses, including any commercial purpose, the terms of a Proprietary Commercial License apply. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Deployment within a for-profit organization.
*   Integration into commercial products or services.
*   Use for revenue-generating activities.
*   Any use by a for-profit entity, regardless of whether direct revenue is generated from the specific use of this software.

### Exception: Commercial Replication Use

Commercial entities may use this software for Replication Use without requiring a Proprietary Commercial License. Replication Use is strictly defined as:

*   Running the Licensed Software as-is, without any modifications to its core functionality or scientific output.
*   The sole purpose of any use or modification under this exception is to reproduce results or behaviors demonstrated by the original, unmodified software.

Permitted modifications for Replication Use are strictly limited to enabling the faithful execution and replication of the original software's behavior in different environments. These include:

*   Changes strictly necessary to enable its execution on a specific hardware backend (e.g., configuring paths, basic environment variables, or compilation without altering logic).
*   Integration with MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks, cloud deployment platforms, or similar infrastructure tools, provided these integrations do not alter the core algorithms, data structures, scientific outputs, or fundamental functionality of the Licensed Software. These modifications are solely for facilitating the deployment, monitoring, or management of the unmodified core software to achieve its original, intended replication.

Any other modifications to the software (e.g., changes to algorithms, data structures, user interfaces, or integration with other proprietary systems that alter the software's core functionality or output beyond simple replication and infrastructure adaptation) require a full Proprietary Commercial License.

The spirit of this exception is to facilitate academic impact and reproducibility within industrial settings, allowing for direct verification and deployment of the original work while enabling its practical integration into modern MLOps pipelines, all strictly for replication purposes.
