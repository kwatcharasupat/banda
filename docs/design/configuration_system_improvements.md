# 5. Configuration System Improvements

The existing Hydra configuration system will be enhanced to fully leverage the proposed registry pattern.

*   **Leveraging Registries:** Configuration files will refer to registered component names (e.g., `model: my_custom_model`, `dataset: musdb18hq_v2`) instead of direct Python class paths (`_target_`). This decouples configuration from implementation details.
*   **Hierarchical Configuration:** Hydra's hierarchical configuration will continue to be used for clear separation of concerns (e.g., `configs/model/`, `configs/data/`) and easy override capabilities, promoting modular and reusable configuration blocks.
*   **Dynamic Loading:** The `train.py` entry point and `SeparationTask` will be updated to use the component registries to dynamically load and instantiate components based on the configuration, making the system highly configurable and adaptable.
