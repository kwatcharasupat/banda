# 6. Testing Strategy

The proposed architectural changes will significantly facilitate a robust testing strategy:

*   **Unit Testing:** Clear interfaces and decoupled components (models, datasets, losses, metrics) will enable isolated unit testing of individual modules, ensuring their correctness and adherence to defined contracts.
*   **Integration Testing:** The registry pattern and dynamic loading will allow for easy integration testing of various component combinations, ensuring that different models, datasets, and loss functions work together seamlessly.
*   **Regression Testing:** A well-defined testing suite will help prevent regressions when new components are added or existing ones are modified, ensuring the stability of the codebase.
